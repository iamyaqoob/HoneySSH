# HoneySSH

The issue of security is the top most priority of any organization. Therefore, developing a module which will be capable of logging the commands typed by the user in order to get the data relevant to him/her. This log will help in yielding a lot of data that can be used for research such as frequency and type of attacks.

My primary motivation for undertaking this project is pure fascination with the modules: Computer Networks and Operating Systems, in particular the security parts of these modules. I'm keen to explore cyberattack commands and computer security vulnerabilities in more detail through this project and research.
